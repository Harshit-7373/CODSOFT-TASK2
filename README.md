This is a replica of the Netflix landing page, which I created as part of my internship at Codsoft. The page is designed to mimic the layout and style of Netflixâ€™s homepage, using only HTML and CSS.

Features
HTML & CSS: Built entirely with HTML for structure and CSS for design.
Responsive Layout: The page is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes, from mobile devices to large desktop screens.
Modern Design: Replicates the clean and modern design of Netflix, including a hero section, call-to-action buttons, and a footer.
Typography & Colors: Styled with similar fonts and color schemes to maintain the Netflix look and feel.


Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the page content.
CSS3: For styling and layout, with a focus on flexbox for responsiveness.
